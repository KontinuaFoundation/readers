To run a postgres DB in development we use Docker / Docker Compose!

An installation of Docker Desktop should provide everything you will need!

Install docker desktop @ https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/get-docker-desktop/

Additionally you will need to setup a .env in the backend root (backend/) with the following:

DB_NAME=readers_backend
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

Then open a terminal and run: docker compose up -d

You can terminate it later with: docker compose down
