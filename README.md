Source code for the e-reader apps

### About the e-reader

Kontinua is an app in Swift Native, for iOS deployment. It will be used on iPads to help children get a STEM education they may not otherwise have available to them. 

### Start PDF Static Server For Development

1. Ensure python3 is installed on your device
2. Navigate to `readers/`
3. Run `./serve_pdf.sh`
4. PDFs and PDF metadata are now served on `localhost:8000`!
5. In Xcode, preview should open up and you can navigate around the app using your mouse

### Running the Project

In XCode you can use the "preview" view, or the "simulator" view. Once you have the server up and running, both views will work and show you the current status of the app.
